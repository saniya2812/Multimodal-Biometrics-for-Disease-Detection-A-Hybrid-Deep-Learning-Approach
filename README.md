Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have transformed various sectors, including healthcare. One of the emerging areas of research is automated disease detection using facial biometrics. This approach leverages AI-driven image processing techniques to analyze facial features and detect potential health conditions. By integrating deep learning algorithms, facial recognition technologies, and medical imaging, this research explores how AI can be used to identify diseases through subtle facial characteristics. This paper discusses the methodologies, challenges, applications, and potential future directions of facial biometrics-based disease detection, highlighting its role in early diagnosis and personalized healthcare.

The increasing reliance on AI-driven solutions in healthcare has led to the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods. Traditional diagnostic techniques often involve invasive procedures or costly medical imaging, making early disease detection a challenge. Facial biometrics, which is commonly used in security and identity verification, is now being explored for medical purposes. Various diseases, including genetic disorders, neurological diseases, and dermatological conditions, can manifest in subtle facial feature variations. 
The integration of AI and facial biometrics provides a novel way to analyze facial characteristics and detect potential health risks. This paper examines the current state of automated disease detection using facial biometrics, its potential applications, and the challenges that need to be addressed to make this technology more effective and reliable.
